# Skill-Based Betting Platform

## Project Description

The Skill-Based Betting Platform is a decentralized smart contract system that enables players to engage in skill-based games with cryptocurrency wagering. Unlike traditional gambling platforms that rely on chance, this platform focuses on games where player skill and strategy determine the outcome, such as chess, poker, trivia, and other competitive games.

The platform operates on a peer-to-peer model where players can create games with specific bet amounts and game types, while other players can join these games by matching the bet. The smart contract handles all fund management, game resolution, and prize distribution automatically, ensuring fair play and transparent transactions.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a trustless, decentralized platform that revolutionizes skill-based gaming by:

- **Eliminating Traditional Gambling**: Moving away from chance-based betting to skill-based competitions
- **Ensuring Fair Play**: Using blockchain technology to guarantee transparent and tamper-proof game outcomes
- **Building Community**: Creating a global community of competitive players across various skill-based games
- **Democratizing Access**: Providing equal opportunity for players worldwide to compete and earn through their skills
- **Promoting Skill Development**: Encouraging players to improve their abilities in strategic and intellectual games
